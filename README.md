Sensor Signal Simulation and Filtering using Python

This project demonstrates basic signal processing concepts used in instrumentation engineering. A sensor signal is simulated using a sine wave, noise is added to represent real-world disturbances, and a filtering technique is applied to recover a smooth signal.
The main objective of this project is to understand how raw sensor data is generated, affected by noise, and processed before being used in practical applications.
The project is implemented using Python with NumPy for numerical computation and Matplotlib for visualization.

Working Concept
A sine wave is used to represent a continuous sensor output over time. Random noise is then added to simulate real measurement errors such as environmental interference or electrical disturbances. A moving average filter is applied to smooth the noisy signal and reveal the original trend.

Applications
The concepts used in this project are relevant to real instrumentation systems such as temperature sensing, biomedical signal processing (ECG), vibration monitoring, and industrial process control.

Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I gained practical understanding of signal generation, noise modelling, basic filtering techniques, and data visualization using Python.

Future Scope
This project can be extended by applying advanced filters, using real sensor datasets, or integrating with hardware-based data acquisition systems.
